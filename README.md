Dynamic Weather Information System

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, REST APIs, OpenWeather API, Geolocation API, LocalStorage

Bullet points:

Developed a responsive weather web application that provides real-time weather, 5-day forecasts, air quality index (AQI), and hourly timelines using REST APIs.

Integrated OpenWeather API to fetch live weather, forecast, and air pollution data with asynchronous JavaScript (fetch & Promise.all).

Implemented location-based weather detection using the browser Geolocation API and automatic data refresh every 15 minutes.

Designed user safety alerts for heat, cold, rain, and poor air quality based on real-time weather thresholds.

Built a search history feature using browser LocalStorage for improved user experience.

Created a clean, responsive UI using modern CSS with cards, icons, and adaptive layouts.
